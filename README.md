 Introduction In this project, we will explore key steps in preparing and applying machine learning
 
 models, with a focus on logistic regression.
 
     • In the first question, we will wrangle and clean a dataset, ensuring it is properly formatted and ready for modeling.
     
     • In the second question, we will take a deeper look at logistic regression, learning how to fit the model and tune its hyperparameters using cross-validation.
     
     • Finally, we will implement gradient descent to solve logistic regression, reinforcing our understanding of optimization techniques in machine learning.
     
 By the end of this project, we will have hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model fitting, and optimization, all essential skills for building effective machine learning models.
